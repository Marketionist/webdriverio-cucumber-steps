## Installation
If you want to start writing tests as fast as possible, here are the commands
you'll need to execute:
```
npm init --yes
npm install webdriverio-cucumber-steps @wdio/cli @wdio/cucumber-framework @wdio/local-runner @wdio/selenium-standalone-service @wdio/spec-reporter chromedriver wdio-chromedriver-service --save-dev
node node_modules/webdriverio-cucumber-steps/utils/prepare.js
```

Then just see the [list of predefined steps](#list-of-predefined-steps) and
start writing tests (in `tests/*.feature`) and adding Page Objects
(in `tests/page-objects/*.js`).

Run the tests with:
```
node_modules/.bin/wdio tests/wdio.conf.js
```

## Importing steps and running tests
To get access to all Cucumber steps defined in this package just add the
path to this package in `wdio.conf.js` configuration file inside `cucumberOpts`
in `require` (pathes to all external and internal step definitions should be
specified inside the array in `require`):
```
const path = require('path');

exports.config = {
    // ...
    specs: [
        path.join(__dirname, '**', '*.feature')
    ],
    // ...
    //
    // Make sure you have the wdio adapter package for the specific framework installed
    // before running any tests.
    framework: 'cucumber',
    // ...
    //
    // If you are using Cucumber you need to specify the location of your step definitions.
    cucumberOpts: {
        // ...
        require: [
            path.join(__dirname, '..', 'node_modules', 'webdriverio-cucumber-steps', 'index.js'),
            // './src/steps/given.js',
            // './src/steps/then.js',
            // './src/steps/when.js',
            // Or search a (sub)folder for JS files with a wildcard
            // works since version 1.1 of the wdio-cucumber-framework
            // './src/**/*.js',
        ],
        // ...
```
and then launch tests with:
```
node_modules/.bin/wdio tests/wdio.conf.js
```

If you store your Page Objects not in `tests/page-objects` folder, then
`PO_FOLDER_PATH` environment variable has to be specified to show the path to
your Page Objects folder when running tests:
```
PO_FOLDER_PATH='tests/my-custom-page-objects' node_modules/.bin/wdio tests/wdio.conf.js
```

> You can specify multiple Page Object folders by separating them with commas:
> `PO_FOLDER_PATH='main/my-custom1,login/my-custom2,auth,create/my-custom3'`

Also you can just add `test:e2e` command to `scripts` in `package.json`:
```
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "PO_FOLDER_PATH='tests/my-custom-page-objects' node_modules/.bin/wdio tests/wdio.conf.js",
    // ...
```
and then launch tests with:
```
npm run test:e2e
```

## List of predefined steps
### Given steps
1. `I/user go(es) to URL "..."` - open a site (by its URL provided in "" as a
string - for example: `"https://github.com/Marketionist"`) in the current
browser window/tab.
2. `I/user go(es) to "..."."..."` - open a site (by its URL provided as a string
in **"page"."object"**) in the current browser window/tab.
- `I/user go(es) to ... from ...` - open a site (by its URL provided as a string
in **object** from **page**) in the current browser window/tab.
3. `I/user set(s) cookie "..."` - set cookie for the current domain (cookie
provided in "" as a string - for example: `"my_test_cookie1=11"`).
- `I/user set(s) cookie "..."."..."` - set cookie for the current domain (cookie
provided as a string in **"page"."object"**).
- `I/user set(s) cookie ... from ...` - set cookie for the current domain
(cookie provided as a string in **object** from **page**).
4. `I/user print(s) cookies` - output all cookies that are currently set.

### Then steps
5. `the title should be "..."` - verify that title of the current browser
window/tab equals to the text (provided in "" as a string).
